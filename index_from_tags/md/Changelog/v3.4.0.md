# Added   
   
- `included_folders` now allows a user to select the folders from the vault to include, the rest is "excluded".    
- `exclude_subfolders`  now also supports glob patterns. This affects both the copying step to the temporary folder, and the file tree generator (for when copying to temp dir is turned off).   
   
# Changes   
   
- Enabling glob support required that values in `exclude_subfolders`  now should start with a slash when excluding a specific folder. Excluding any folder with the given name, the starting slash should be dropped.
