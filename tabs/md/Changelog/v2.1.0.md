## Graph view   
   
- It is now possible to [write a custom graph view template](../Configurations/Styling/Writing%20a%20custom%20graph%20view%20template.md).   
- The default graph is now the 3d built-in template, based on [force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph) instead of d3.js   
   
## Call-outs   
   
- Added in this version   
- Achieved feature parity (as far as I can tell), but there might be some bugs/styling tweaks to be done in following patch versions   
- Read more: [Implementing Call-outs](../Demonstrations/Implementing%20Call-outs.md)
