> Feature version of [v2.0.0](../Changelog/v2.0.0.md)   
   
## Graph view   
   
- It is now possible to [write a custom graph view template](../Configurations/Styling/Writing%20a%20custom%20graph%20view%20template.md).   
- The default graph is now the 3d built-in template, based on [force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph) instead of d3.js
