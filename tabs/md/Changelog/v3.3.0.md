## Added features   
   
- A first MVP of [Embedded search](../Demonstrations/Embedded%20search.md) was added   
- Glob pattern support added to [Create Index from Directory Structure](../Configurations/Create%20Index%20from%20Directory%20Structure.md) feature.   
   
## Changes   
   
- The setting `force_filename_to_lowercase`  would make graph labels lowercase, this has been changed so it doesn't affect graph labels. For your own graphers, make sure to use `node['name']` instead of `node['id']`.
