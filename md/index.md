# Example Site   
   
This is an example project showing off the capabilities of [Obsidian-html](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html).   
   
In short, this code converts Obsidian notes to proper markdown, and then spits out a site like this. [You can find the generated markdown here](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html.github.io/tree/main/md).   
   
See also this site, which uses purely this code: [devfruits.com](https://www.devfruits.com).   
   
> All credit to this site's design goes to Andy Matuschak. I basically [stole his design](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) because I think it is perfect.
