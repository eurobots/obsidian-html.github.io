# Creating a static html website from markdown files   
The second step is to take the generated proper markdown files and convert them into a website. You are looking at the endproduct of this step.   
   
See [Features](Configurations/Features.md) for all the ways in which you can influence this step.    
   
You can for example [add in your own stylesheets/script files](Configurations/Configuration%20Options.md#html-custom-inclusions), and [edit the html template](Configurations/Configuration%20Options.md#html-template-path-str) (or just provide your own template entirely), among other things.
