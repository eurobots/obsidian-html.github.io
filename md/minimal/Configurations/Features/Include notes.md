The normal obsidian code inclusion syntax of `![[note]]` works as intended.   
   

   
The only difference is that the code is pasted inline, so it is not visible that the text is included. This paragraph comes from a different note, for example.
   
   
## Include specific header   
If you want to only include the text under a header called 'header', then you can use `![[note#header]]`.   
   
If you need specificity in selecting a subheader, you can type `![[note#header#subheader]]` instead of `![[note#subheader]]` when needed.
