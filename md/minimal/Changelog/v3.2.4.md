> Patch version of [v3.2.0](../Changelog/v3.2.0.md). Not out yet.   
   
## Changes   
   
- The setting `force_filename_to_lowercase`  would make graph labels lowercase, this has been changed so it doesn't affect graph labels. For your own graphers, make sure to use `node['name']` instead of `node['id']`.
