# Create Index from Directory Structure   
If you want to build an index note on the fly, where it just shows the directory structure of the html output, then you can enable this feature.   
   
> Note: As opposed to [Create index from tags](../Configurations/Create%20index%20from%20tags.md), this is not a note selection feature. This is an HTML-only addon that creates a new html page to the HTML output folder, like the [Tags Page](../Configurations/Tags%20Page.md) feature. [Overwriting the homepage](../Configurations/Create%20Index%20from%20Directory%20Structure.md#set-output-path) is optional, and not the default setting.   
   
## Example   
You can view an index that is created in this way under [/obs.html/dir_index.html](/obs.html/dir_index.html). This is the default location if you choose to enable this feature.   
   
## Minimal configuration   
The minimal configuration of this feature is extremely easy:   
   
``` yaml
toggles
  features:
    create_index_from_dir_structure:
      enabled: True
```
   
   
## Exclude folders/files   
But there is a good chance that you will want to exclude folders and/or files from being shown on the index page. This is our configuration, for reference:   
   
``` yaml 
    create_index_from_dir_structure:
      enabled: True
      exclude_subfolders:
        - ".git"
        - "__src"
        - "md"
        - "obs.html"
        - "Resources"
      exclude_files:
        - "favicon.ico"
        - "not_created.html"
```
   
   
The defaults for these settings can be found via [Configuration Options#Get all the default settings](../Configurations/Configuration%20Options.md#get-all-the-default-settings). At the time of writing these are:   
   
```yaml
    create_index_from_dir_structure:
      enabled: False
      rel_output_path: 'obs.html/dir_index.html'
      styling: 
        show_icon: True
      exclude_subfolders:
        - ".git"
        - "__src"
        - "md"
        - "obs.html"
      exclude_files:
        - "favicon.ico"
        - "not_created.html"
```
   
   
## Set output path   
If you want to use the index generated by this feature as your homepage, then a configuration like this might work for you:   
   
```yaml
    create_index_from_dir_structure:
      enabled: True
      rel_output_path: 'index.html'
      styling: 
        show_icon: False
      exclude_subfolders:
        - ".git"
        - "__src"
        - "md"
        - "obs.html"
      exclude_files:
        - "favicon.ico"
        - "not_created.html"
        - "index.html"
```
   
   
Note the `rel_output_path` setting.
