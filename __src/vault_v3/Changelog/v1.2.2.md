# v1.2.2
> bugfix for [[v1.2.0]]

## Bugfixes 
Bugfix for a little bug where a halting error occurs when [[Configuration Options#verbose_printout|toggles/verbose_printout]] is true, due to a faulty concatenation in a print statement somewhere. [See also](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/pull/203).

Also added a [regression test](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/204) for this.

## Config changes
Removed the behavior where [[Relative_path_html]] automatically disabled [[Graph view]] and enables [[NoTabs Mode]]. (Read more about this on the Relative_path_html page).
