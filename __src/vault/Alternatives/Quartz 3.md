# Quartz 3
ObsidianHtml aims to be plug-and-play. You input your vault in the configuration, and an html website should *just* pop out.

Though if you want to do a bit more of a setup, a nice website generator is [Quartz 3](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). Just like ObsidianHtml, it creates a static html website that can be published for free using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

It features a quick search function that ObsidianHtml lacks, and a nice tag system to find related notes, that is kind of like our [[Tags Page]], but more integrated, and with previews.
