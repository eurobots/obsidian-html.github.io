# Implementing Latex
At the moment only the math based latex is enabled. (It's hard to find what Obsidian supports other than the math based latex.)


## Inline Latex (single $)
``` latex
A nice equation for testing is $\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta x+e^{-i\theta}$

I can also use symbols like $\pi$ inside of a line.
```

## Centered block latex (double $)
``` latex
$$
\begin
{vmatrix}a & b \\ c & d
\end
{vmatrix}=ad-bc
$$
```

\begin
{vmatrix}a & b \\ c & d
\end
{vmatrix}=ad-bc
