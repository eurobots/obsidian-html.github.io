The normal obsidian code inclusion syntax of `![[note]]` works as intended.

![[Demonstrate inclusion]]

## Include specific header
If you want to only include the text under a header called 'header', then you can use `![[note#header]]`.

If you need specificity in selecting a subheader, you can type `![[note#header#subheader]]` instead of `![[note#subheader]]` when needed.
