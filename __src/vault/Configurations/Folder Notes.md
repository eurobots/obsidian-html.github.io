# Folder Notes
If you like to organize your notes into a lot of separate folders,  then folder notes might be something for you.



``` yaml
toggles:
  features:
    folder_notes:
      enabled: True
      placement: 'outside folder'   # 'inside folder' , 'outside folder' 
      naming: 'folder name'           # 'folder name', 'index'
```
