# NoTabs Mode
> New in version [[v1.2.0]]

*Don't like how the [[HTML tweaks#Tabbing system|tabs]] work? You can disable them if you want a simpler browsing experience.*

## Example
View this site in no_tabs mode: https://obsidian-html.github.io/no_tabs/

## Configure
>This setting is enforced when `relative_path_html: True`.

Set the following key in your config.yml:
``` yaml
toggles:
  no_tabs: True
```
