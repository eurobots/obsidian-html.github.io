# NoTabs Mode
> New in version [[v1.2.0]]

*Don't like how the tabs work? You can disable them if you want a simpler browsing experience.*

Set the following key in your config.yml:
``` yaml
toggles:
  no_tabs: True
```

View this site in no_tabs mode: https://obsidian-html.github.io/no_tabs/

This setting is enforced when `relative_path_html: True`.
