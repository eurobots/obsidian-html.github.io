# v1.0.2
Patch version of [[v1.0.0]].

> **Note**: Pypi docs claim there are config changes in this release, but this was reverted. (I can't update the pypi docs without releasing a new version). No config changes in this release!

## Bugfixes
### Links in included notes do not work / show up as external
This is caused by `relative_path_md: True` not working with includes, as includes are still too stupid to rewrite the relative paths found in the note that is included.

Weird thing was that `relative_path_md: False` also did not work. This is the actual bug: this config settings was not integrated everywhere that it should. Setting this value to False now resolves the links showing up wrong in included notes.

- See the exploration of the bug here: https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/178
- See also [[How to resolve common issues#Links in included notes do not work show up as external]]
- When [this change](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/179) is completed, it will be possible to have the links work even with `relative_path_md: True`  
- A [regression test](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/180) will be added for this case, so it will not return.
