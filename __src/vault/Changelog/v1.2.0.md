# v1.2.0
> Feature version of [[v1.0.0]].

## Added features
- [[Relative_path_html]] mode
	- Can be used to compile to HTML for which you don't need to run a http server to view the site (for local/personal use).
- [[NoTabs Mode]]
	- Added to make relative_path_html mode feasible / tidy up the code. But can be used to get a more simple browsing experience.
