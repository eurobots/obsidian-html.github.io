## Added features
- It is now possible to configure vault files to be exported to any path in the html output folder. [[Export vault files to html output]].
- The rsync copy method was added. This should be way quicker and be less buggy on MacOS. This is set as the default. If rsync is not present it fallsback to the older shutil method. Read more: [[Copy vault to temp dir]]
