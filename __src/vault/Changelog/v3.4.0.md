> Feature version of [[v3.0.0]]. 

# Added
- `included_folders` now allows a user to select the folders from the vault to include, the rest is "excluded". See also [#451](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/451).
- `exclude_subfolders`  now also supports glob patterns. This affects both the copying step to the temporary folder, and the file tree generator (for when copying to temp dir is turned off).
- Image titles can now be added alongside scaling, use for example:
  ``` md
  ![cat|100](200w.gif)
  ![[200w.gif|cat|100]]
  ```
  - Inclusions are now shown in the graph view with dotted edges. See also [#425](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/425).
	  - Can be turned off with:
	  ``` yaml
      graph:
        show_inclusions_in_graph: False
	  ```
- [[Note settings]] expanded, have a browse there.
- Added `homepage_label` to [[Create Index from Directory Structure]] to overwrite the `index` list item to e.g. `My homepage`.
- All localStorage calls are now wrapped to fail gracefully to allow a visitor to disable javascript if the compiled website is properly configured. See [#352](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/352).
- Folders with an associated [[Folder Notes|folder note]] can now also be closed in the dirtree pane created by [[Create Index from Directory Structure]]. See [#469](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/469).

# Features
- [[Side panes]] feature was added. For this, the [[Create index from tags]] feature was modernized to be able to properly provide content for either side pane.


# Bugfixes
- Fixed: [Obsidian links not parsed correctly when parentheses are present without a space](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/532)
- Fixed: [Empty embed links cause a crash](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/536). 
	- Changed this so it just creates an empty img tag.
- Fixed: [ImportError: cannot import name 'UnescapeTreeprocessor' from 'markdown.treeprocessors'](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/474). 
	- Added minimum requirement for markdown in setup.cfg.
- Fixed: [Inline tags and code blocks not working in footnotes](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/512)
- Fixed: [Imagescaling regression](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/515)

- Fixed: [General latex parsing bug](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/521)
	- Latex was not properly treated as a code block, resulting in a whole family of potential bugs where obsidianhtml would edit the latex code block before it could be parsed by python-markdown/latex.js
- Fixed: [Single-line callouts don't work](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/488)
- Fixed: [Scrollbar missing in contents pane](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/496)

# Changes
- Alterations in [[Create index from tags]]
- Alterations in [[Embedded note title]] to accomodate changes in Obsidian
- Enabling glob support required that values in `exclude_subfolders`  now should start with a slash when excluding a specific folder. Excluding any folder with the given name, the starting slash should be dropped.
