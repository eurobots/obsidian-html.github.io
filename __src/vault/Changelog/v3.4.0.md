> Feature version of [[v3.0.0]]. 
> Not published yet


# Added
- `included_folders` now allows a user to select the folders from the vault to include, the rest is "excluded". 

# Changes
- `exclude_subfolders`  now also supports glob patterns. This affects both the copying step to the temporary folder, and the file tree generator (for when copying to temp dir is turned off).
- This causes that values in `exclude_subfolders` are now required to start with a slash when excluding a specific folder. Excluding any folder with the given name, the starting slash should be dropped.
