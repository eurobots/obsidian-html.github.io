> Feature version of [[v3.0.0]]. 
> **Not published yet!**

## Added features
- A first MVP of [[Embedded search]] was added
- Glob pattern support added to [[Create Index from Directory Structure]] feature.

## Changes
- The setting `force_filename_to_lowercase`  would make graph labels lowercase, this has been changed so it doesn't affect graph labels. For your own graphers, make sure to use `node['name']` instead of `node['id']`.
