# v2.3.0
> Feature version of [[v2.0.0]]


## Refactor
- The minimal template has been added to allow for lighter weight websites. For this to work well, all the little features should be able to be turned on/off at will. These settings have been added. Read more: [[Performance Tuning]].
- The number of css files has been growing, and there was a lot of duplication and conflicts going on during development. The general code has been moved to global_main.css and features get their own css file too. Ongoing project.
- Same story for the obsidian.js file. It has been split into obsidian_core_header.js and obsidian_core_footer.js and all specific code has been moved into files that can be included/excluded at will.

## Life cycle
- Upgraded to mermaid 9.0.1. (from unknown version) and corrected the missing source map which gave an error when opening developer tools.
