# Deprecated and removed config settings
If you update ObsidianHtml and run it, you might get a message that a setting has been removed. We could have opted to just only give a warning, but experience tells us that most people won't notice warnings. As the removed setting won't have any effect anymore the correct course of action is to remove it.

The error message will also give you a setting path, you can look that path up here and see what it has been replaced with.

## toggles/no_tabs
This setting has been merged with other settings into a feature block called [[Styling]].
