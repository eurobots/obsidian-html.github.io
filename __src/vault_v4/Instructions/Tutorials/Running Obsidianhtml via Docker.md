This is a nice way to run Obsidianhtml if you don't want to pollute your main environment, or when you are having issues installing/running Obsidianhtml, for example [[Running Obsidianhtml on Windows|on Windows]].

It does require you to install Docker, but this is very well supported cross platform, and pretty easily done.

## Instruction
