Built-in modules are packaged with ObsidianHtml, this allows us to easily define them, and load components from ObsidianHtml. 

External modules are modules that you can write for yourself, without any pull request to get your code into ObsidianHtml.

See the page [[Creating a custom Module]] for a walkthrough on how to build your own external module.
