<p>The first major version of ObsidianHtml! ðŸŽ‰   </p>
<p>The reason to jump over to version 1 is that most of the features that were really itching to be added have been added by now.    </p>
<p>We've also focussed on removing any irritating techical debt that had accumulated after the flurry of new features, better documentation, and a consistent effort in regression testing for each new feature. With all of this we hope to guarantee more stability when adding more features/bugfixes in the future.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>From now on, normal semantic versioning will be followed. This means a new patch version on every bug fixed, and a new minor version when a new feature is added. For breaking changes, we'll go up a major version.   </p>

<h2 id="new-in-this-version">New in this version</h2>
<p><a href="/minimal/Configurations/Create Index from Directory Structure.html">Create Index from Directory Structure</a> has been added and gives us the directory tree icon in the topright of the page, which gives a clickable file tree of the html output, for those of us who have very organised folders and like to navigate this way.   </p>
<p><a href="/minimal/Configurations/RSS Feed.html">RSS Feed</a> has been added. This page is on our own feed that we publish this way. Read more about RSS here: <a href="https://meganesulli.com/blog/how-rss-works/" class="external-link">https://meganesulli.com/blog/how-rss-works/</a> and add our feed to your reader by clicking on the RSS icon in the top right of the page!   </p>
<p>Minor notable changes:   </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/minimal/Configurations/Configuration Options.html#included_file_suffixes">included_file_suffixes</a> now configurable   </li>
<li>graph.json now contains metadata of the notes. This is nice for those who like <a href="/minimal/Configurations/Configuration Options.html#html-template-path-str">making their own templates</a> as now more information is available. Check out <a href="https://obsidian-html.github.io/obs.html/data/graph.json" class="external-link">our graph.json</a>   </li>
<li>All the static files we produce are now bundled in <code>/obs.html/</code>, instead of multiple different folders. Way more future proof!   </li>
</ul>
