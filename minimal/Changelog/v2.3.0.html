<p>Feature version of <a href="/minimal/Changelog/v2.0.0.html">v2.0.0</a>   </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="refactor">Refactor</h2>
<ul>
<li>The minimal template has been added to allow for lighter weight websites. For this to work well, all the little features should be able to be turned on/off at will. These settings have been added. Read more: <a href="/minimal/Configurations/Performance Tuning.html">Performance Tuning</a>.   </li>
<li>The number of css files has been growing, and there was a lot of duplication and conflicts going on during development. The general code has been moved to global_main.css and features get their own css file too. Ongoing project.   </li>
<li>Same story for the obsidian.js file. It has been split into obsidian_core_header.js and obsidian_core_footer.js and all specific code has been moved into files that can be included/excluded at will.   </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="life-cycle">Life cycle</h2>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded to mermaid 9.0.1. (from unknown version) and corrected the missing source map which gave an error when opening developer tools.</li>
